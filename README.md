# csdc-scoreboard

Scoring prototype based on a butchery of [zxc
dcss-scoreboard](https://github.com/zxc23/dcss-scoreboard) and [Kramin's
logfile api](https://github.com/Kramin42/Crawl-Log-Api).

While it may seem like I know what I am doing with this I do not.

I am allergic to frameworks so the way this thing runs is there's gonna be a
`main.py` that fetches the logfiles into the db and then builds the website. Currently
`dldb.py` does the former only.
